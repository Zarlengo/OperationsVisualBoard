## Top Screen is live monitoring of machine parameters
Monitors pressure, temperature, motor shifting, hydraulic levels and temperature, efficiency, and status.


## Bottom Screen is live monitoring of the quality of machine output
Monitors the quality of each part coming off of each machine separated out by day. Green are parts passing inspection, red are failed, and grey are ones are work in progress (have begun machine processing and have not been through final inspection).

The weekly production summary is tracked in addition to maintenance items notifying the operators when they need to replace a component.
